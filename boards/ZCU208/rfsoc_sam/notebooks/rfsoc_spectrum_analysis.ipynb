    "## Introduction <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"introduction\"></a>\n",
    "The Zynq RFSoC contains high frequency samplers known as RF Data Converters (RF DCs). The RF DCs are tightly coupled with the Programmable Logic (PL), creating a high-throughput, low-latency path between the FPGA and analogue world. The Spectrum Analyzer Module employs the RF Analogue-to-Digital Converters (RF ADCs) to receive RF time domain signals. The received data is manipulated using spectral pre-processing techniques in the PL, to prepare it for frequency domain analysis and visualisation in the Processing System (PS).\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant portion of the design has been implemented in the RFSoC's PL to prevent the PS from applying highly computational arithemtic. There is a Spectrum Analyzer Module for each available RF ADC channel in the design. The Spectrum Analyzers are also interfaced to their very own flexible decimator, allowing different sample rates to be configured for each channel."

    "The ZCU208 development boards require the SMA and clock connections to be setup correctly. We will begin with connecting the clocks from the Clk104 card to the development board. Then connect the ADCs and DACs to the HW_XM_655 card's RF baluns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin with the setup below, ensure that the Clk104 card and HW_XM_655 card is securely connected to the ZCU208 development board.\n",

    "The next step is to connect the ADCs to the RF Baluns on the HW_XM_655 card. See the image below in [Figure 2](#fig-2) on how to make these connections successfully. You will need the rectangle connector that contains a strip of wires with SMAs attached to make this connection.
